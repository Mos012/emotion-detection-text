But á she had an audience and was in one of those moods. Once I'd á accepted it was something everyone does at time I felt better - á it was partly having my friend there.	5
2700	In my 20s - and was going out to dinner to celebrate a friend's á birthday. Her (older - in 30s) cousin, really wanted me to get á drunk cos I'd visited their (cousin & wife) place quite a bit, á but had always been very careful - brought up to believe in á moderation in drink (but not guilt repression etc). I mixed á drinking with smoking (which I rarely did) and got drunk and had á to leave the table to get sick in the loo, and later went home á and was sick again; have never felt so awful in my life. And I á didn't want to face or tell my other flatmates, or family.	6
2701	I used to pinch change from my father's mantlepiece (never my á mother - she didn't get enough housekeeping) and then I'd feel á when we went to church as a family I'd felt awkward cos I felt á I'm expected to go to communion and I would but I was afraid and á guilty 'cos I committed a mortal sin.	7

3120	A gathering of a social sports club at which they proceeded to á show pornographic videos and then afterwards (when most people á had had quite a bit to drink) carried on in a very degrading, á unmoral manner - especially females exposing and flaunting á themselves with no shame or embarassment.	5
3121	"Like guilt - the most ashamed I have ever felt was when I began á to feel guilty about having sex with my boyfriend when it was á only \the thing to do\"", and not really an act of love."""	6
3122	This feeling of guilt really applies to moral/religious views. I á (being Catholic) went against what I was brought up to believe in á and had a sexual relationship with my boyfriend. Many months á later, when I was doing some deeper self analysis I began to feel á guilty and realized that I had gone against what I wanted for á myself and my future.	7
3123	My mother along with some of my friends gave me a surprise á birthday party - they invited a large number of my friends along á too.	1
3124	My mother did not come home till late at night (Ages ago). Anyway á if I don't know where my parents are and when they'll be back I á start thinking that perhaps they have had an accident and are á perhaps dead.	2
3125	Because I am the Captain of a basketball team I usually organise á a roster system so that everyone in the team can have a turn at á doing either a duty or a ref. A lot of the time the girls can't á be bothered or just forget - I usually have to fill in.	3
3126	So as to be closer to the university I have left home and moved á into Auckland. It now seems as if I have left home - especially á my family - forever.	4
3127	A friend of mine goes out with this guy. She sleeps with him but á is quite happy for him to play around - as well as herself.	5
3128	NO RESPONSE.	6
3129	I did not attend a social studies observation class for 1 whole á week (I am a student trainee teacher). Anyway the other teachers á thought this was okay because the teacher I was supposed to á observe was not well liked. The teacher was in fact really nice á to me - but I wanted to get out of teaching a hard topic he had á given me.	7
3130	Passing my pharmacy exams which meant my tertiary education for á pharmacy completed.	1
3131	When I was in a car with my parents and friends and we had to á back up (reverse) pass a river which when I recall it (I was only á about 5 yrs) seemed we were going to fall in and drown.	2
3132	When my boyfriend wouldn't dance with me on my graduation night á because he thought I could dance with my friends who were á friendly.	3

3136	When I had to go to reconciliation before converting to á Catholicism but then once received - o.k.	7

3138	I had this experience of fear when few people were fighting at a á social one night, which one of my relative was involved. My fear á was greatly for him because he was being assaulted badly.	2
3139	Never really had the experience just yet - N/A.	3
3140	This occurred when my girlfriend and I have to finish our á relationship due to some circumstances between her and her á family. I was really sad, hurt and couldn't really find any á reason why am I still living. Is this life is all about ? This á was one of few question which crept up vividly every time I á thought about what had happened.	4
3141	I'm very disgusted when I see people abusing their body with á drugs and alcohol. They take advantage of these things usually á for an excuse for the fantasies which they like and so they do á things stupidly and unjustly.	5
3142	NO RESPONSE.	6
3143	This I experienced when going around with more than one girl.	7

3149	When ditched - divorced by husband.	6
3150	When I had to lie about my age to be accepted as a member of a á group.	7
3151	My cousin asked me to be a bridesmaid for her. This made really á happy because I was adopted into the family and her asking me á made me realise that she saw me as a cousin and not just another á person. There were other cousins she could have asked but she á asked me.	1
3152	That if ever I was really naughty I would be sent away from my á Mum and Dad to another family. I was fostered from age 5 and á didn't get to Mum and Dad until I was 6 and then legally adopted á at 14.	2
3153	(1) My father died. (2) My natural father contacted me a year á after my father died and this angered me more as I thought he á should be dead and not my father.	3
3154	My father died. I was away at the time and did not know until two á days after.	4
3155	A child told me she had been sexually abused by her step-father. á I only knew the child and had not come into contact with either á parent. I tried to do what was best for the child. The event and á the stepfather disgusted me.	5
3156	When my natural parents name would show up on papers and not my, á what I call real name.	6
3157	I lied to my mother in the sixth form she said she would ring to á find out and I had to tell her I had lied.	7

3163	When I went to explain to a lecturer whom I liked that the work á expected of me was not going to be in.	6
3164	When I masturbated in my room.	7
3165	When my lover and I felt like we had gone full circle. And our á relationship was new, fresh, vital etc. once again.	1
3166	My daughter was 2 yrs she went up to a colt tried to hit it. It á turned on her and kicked her over the heart, sent her flying á through the air. I left my mother and sister to deal to her as á they are nurses. I felt I didn't want to know if she was going to á die, it was just too much.	2
3167	My anger is with men, their inability to be human (not all men).	3
3168	The saddest I've ever been was when my lover was killed, á hitch-hiking to work.	4
3169	With the N.Z. Rugby Union wanting to send the All Blacks to South á Africa.	5
3170	That my brother and father are into alcohol, two men with á priviledge. Not using it positively.	6
3171	When I betrayed my lover, she told me something in confidence, I á felt at the time I had to relay the information back to the á person concerned, as I felt the situation volitile, did this á without telling my lover, she felt like piggy in the middle, as á she was not directly concerned. Maybe you could call it gossip I á felt different after I had slept on it. If I had waited, thought, á NOW I would not have done it.	7
3172	"A good friend, the wife of the vicar of my church came up to me á from the pews (I am in the choir) and shook my hand during the á time for an informal \greeting\"" in the church service. She said a á"	1
3173	I walked up the main street of Auckland at 10 o'clock at night. I á expected it to be very active with people, gangs, fast cars etc, á thought it was actually quite quiet, though also oppressive. I á walked about half a mile and bought a drink along the way.	2
3174	Someone in my family (my brother I suspected) ate a bun which I á had made for myself. It was during a long telephone call after I á had just made it and put it in the oven warming drawer.	3
3175	Sitting in a bus, I heard behind, the voice of a girl I was á friendly with. After her talking for some time with another girl á I decided it wasn't her in fact that someone miming her, which it á was when I finally looked. I was talking to a friend at the time.	4
3176	Having moved into a flat within the last week I felt some disgust á that a bathroom tap had been left to drip with a faulty fawcet.	5
3177	I criticised an action of my mother and for the first time she á genuinely took notice of it. I felt shame that I was almost á taking the part of a husband, or at least an equal which I should á not.	6
3178	I felt that I contributed to a possible rift in the relationship á between a boy and girl soon to be married, in my flat after I á moved in. After stating my celibacy to him which she overheard á and didn't previously know about I suspect.	7
3179	My friend replying to my letter and again saying he was attracted á to me and suggesting we write, talk and get together and see how á things went and his suggestion that I could ring and doing that it á was really good - though really insane conversation.	1
3180	Being sexually assaulted (not rape, but passionate kissing) by a á friend's father - he stopped when he was driving me home. I á hadn't wanted the lift, had refused 3 times, and then felt it'd á be rude to refuse again. Was really afraid of what he might do.	2
3181	I live by myself and a few weeks ago was woke by a man on the end á of my bed coming up my bed at me. I was really angry, told him to á get out. He was surprised, hesitated; I started to move towards á him and he backed off - kept telling him - loudly, but firmly to á go. Because I'd got the initiative, I succeeded. A very powerful á message.	3
3182	"When my grandmother died - I wasn't sad so much that she'd died á because she was old, but because she lived in the last few years á in an old people's home and had nothing very much that was hers - á no chair, or private space, and when I went to visit she would be á sitting in the \lliving\"" room the TV room. It was hopeless. And I á"	4

3210	When I decided to leave my steady, secure employment to come to á university. Because I didn't know if I could cope with all the á requirements of study and also being older I didn't know if I á would enjoy mixing with younger people, also financial á insecurity.	2
3211	When a close friend failed to live up to the expectations I had á of him - thereby causing pain to his spouse. I believe that my á anger was probably a reaction of fear that I wouldn't be able to á live up to my own expectations.	3

3234	My older sister used to pick on my brothers and sisters all of á whom were younger than her. On one occasion my brother did á something my sister didn't like. A full-scale battle began.	5

5861	When I could not pass my exams with good marks.  My wedding was á to take place 15 days after the exams and I tried to convince á myself that this was the reason for my not having done well.   á However, I thought that had I really put my mind to doing well at á the exams I would have done well.	6
5862	When I succeeded in achieving a scholarship for which I had á strived hard during a period of financial, personal and physical á stress.	1

5870	Uncleaniness at my work place.  The place is generally not very á clean, but when it reaches a point, I get angry at the person á who is supposed to clean the place and the people who are á supposed to supervise him.	3
5871	Three weeks ago a friend of mine bid me good-bye before going á abroad.  I felt happy for her as she was achieving something by á making the trip, but I also felt sad as I would not be seeing her á for a long time.	4
5872	When we complained about the uncleanliness of the work place, the á authorities agreed to have the place cleaned.  Even after 2-3 á days nothing had been done.  I felt disgusted at the whole á situation.	5

5889	When I was blamed for some of my attributes which are very often á misunderstood, especially when one is very frank.	3

5891	When I was in a Christian institution, sometimes the nuns would á send back the people who came to visit us when it was not the á visiting hours.  This disgusted me.	5

5903	When my son fell off the cot at the age of 5 months, I became á very nervous and thought that it would cause defects in his head.  	2
5904	I was very angry one day when my husband ignored me and slept      á on a separate bed.  He had no reasons to doubt me or to neglect á me and I had never imagined that he could do such a thing.	3
5905	When I heard the news of the death of my father.  It was in the á evening and I was alone all night in my room trying to remember á the face of my father.	4
5906	One day my colleague misbehaved with me.  I felt disgusted and á thought to myself that he could only do this because I was a á woman.	5
5907	One day I addressed my husband in an abusive manner in front of á his friends.  Later on I realized this myself and felt ashamed of á myself.	6
5908	My mother misunderstood me and prevented me from doing something. á  In return I did not talk to her for a few days, only later on I á realized that what she had done had been for my good.	7
5909	When the results of the part I exams came out I felt tremendous á joy in my heart.  The results came out after a long period of á worry and anxiety, so it gave me endless relief and joy.	1
5910	I felt afraid just before receiving the question paper of the á part II exam.	2
5911	I remember that when I was in school I saw a case of partiality - á one of the teachers gave private coaching classes to some girls á and she would give these girls extra attention in class and would á ignore the others.	3
5912	On the last day of my school life I was very sad, specially on á the farewell party day.  I felt sad to leave behind my beloved á teachers and friends.	4
5913	I was most disgusted when I had to make a nagging three day á journey recently from Calcutta to Bombay.  It was very boring and á tiring.	5
5914	I remember that once, a friend did not co-operate with me due to á some unavoidable reasons.  Unaware of this I treated her unjustly á till I realized everything, and then I felt ashamad of my deeds. 	6
5915	I did badly in one of the vital exams, despite getting proper á guidance from my parents.  I felt guilty of improper use of the á chances provided to me. 	7
5916	When my honest intentions were marred by another's jealousy.	4
5917	When an event took place in another's life and which I thought I á could have avoided.	7
5918	The day I was happiest was the day when I received a phone call á from Eve's Weekly to inform me that I had won the first prize of á the All India Essay competition.  I had won this prize when I was á an under-graduate when even post graduates had participated.  I á had been judged by eminent judges and political scientists.	1
5919	Fear is an emotion that I experience very often.  Naturally this á is during exams and subsequently while waiting for the results.  á However there is one occassion when I was paralyzed with fear.  á This was when I was doing my M.A.-I, and we had a series of student á lectures.  I was one of the participants and my lecture happened á to be the opening lecture.  I had been confident all morning, about á twenty minutes before the lecture, my confidence started failing á me.  I felt my heart go cold, my lips go dry and I was really á paralyzed.  This incident of fear is still fresh.	2
5920	I experience this emotion quite often but the day I was most á angry was the day I got pulled up for something I had not done.  á It happened during my school days, I had not spoken a word in á class but the monitor had written my name on the board.  So I á had a remark in my callender which I had to get signed by my á parents.  This remark resulted in me being spanked.	3
5921	I have once been very sad and lonely.  This was when I was trying á to organize a play as a student (15 years).  Instead of á materializing, it fizzled out.  The worst thing was that the play á fell apart completely and I found myself weeping uncontrollably.  á Now when I think of it, I laugh it off; but at that time it was á intense.	4
5922	"This is an incident that many of us witness in our everyday life á in a city like Bombay.  One day I was travelling by bus, three á men dragged two fellows out of the bus.  Once outside they were á beaten into pulp.  These two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets á and they were being beaten by all and sundry.  I thought to á myself -\what is life?\"".  It is one hell of a place where á"	5
5923	This is an event I will never forget.  I am considered a good á mimic.  This particular day we were waiting for a professor á to take her class.  This  professor had a peculiar accent and a á very horrible way of lecturing and to top it all we had this á class at the fag end of the day.  So this particular day I got á into my element and started imitating the professor, and the á professor entered the class right in the middle of it .  I was á unaware of her presence, some of my friends tried to warn me but á it was of no avail as I was too engrossed in mimicing.  Then I á suddenly noticed the silence and turned around to see her á entering the class.  I do not know till today if she actually saw á what I had been doing or she had completely ignored it.  Through  á out that lecture I died of shame.  All the more shameful was the á fact that she gave me a character certificate. 	6
5924	This happened when it was finally confirmed that I had stood á first in the university for the M.A exams.  A few days before the á official results were declared a clerk had brought the results á unofficially.  So I had been expecting the results but the á confirmation allowed me to legitimately feel happy at my á success. á 	1
5925	This was when I was being followed home every day from the campus, á by a stranger.  He would follow me to the campus and then sit á outside my class.  If I was not there he would ask my friends as á to where I was.  He was a dark, ominous looking person and I was á terrified of him as I did not know his intentions.  I reported á him to the security officer, who turned him over to the police.  á I was even more petrified then.	2
5926	A new gas connection was to be installed and the mechanic who came á to do it was very rude to my mother and me.  I rushed to thhe á dealer with my mother and had a fight with the dealer as he á seemed to be unreasonable and was taking the mechanic's side.  á Ultimately the matter was resolved after my father went and spoke á to him.  The mechanic was asked to apologize.	3
5927	The day I was to receive my gold-medal for the M.A, my á grandmother, who I loved very much, died after an illness.  She  á died a few hours before the convocation.  While I was á attending the convocation I had to control my grief as she would á not have liked me to miss it.  It was a day she had been waiting á for, but did not get to see. 	4
5928	We had come back from a programme and we were all (three girls)    á staying over at another girls placce.  One of them started á passing very nasty and outright bitchy remarks at me.  It was á brought on by a male colleague's compliments to me, this girl was á herself interested in this guy.  Bitchiness and catty remarks á made by women never fail to disgust me.  I can particularly á remember this incident as she knew that I had not encouraged the  á guy.	5
5929	I was learning judo and my instructor wanted me to assist him in á teaching girls judo at a suburban college.  I was just a beginer, á and he made me a green belt so that I would be able to command á respect.  This was against my principles, and yet I allowed myself á to listen to him.  I gave it up soon after, however I felt very á ashamed at not sticking to my principles and at not having put my á foot down earlier.	6
5930	I was coming back home with my mother when the purse I was á carrying got stolen.  It was done so swifty that I did not á realize what had happened till much later.  A lot of money and the á keys of the house were lost.  I was guilt ridden at my á carelessness.  I felt terrible as I do not normally loose things á and this was quite important, especially the keys.á 	7
5931	Inter-national sports events won by my favourite national team or á player brings me joy, e.g when India won the World cup cricket á match.	1

5938	Despite our good performance and excellent results the management á refused to meet our demands.	3
5939	When my beloved girlfriend got married to another person.	4
5940	When I heard that a 14 years old girl had been raped by four á rikshaw drivers in our town.	5
5941	I feel ashamed at the fact that even after 35 years of independence   á 70% of the Indian poulation is still below the poverty line.	6
5942	I read about the national and social spirit and self-discipline á of the people of developed coutries like U.S.A, England, France, á Germany etc.  Comparing this to the Indian people I felt guilty á as they have no national spirit or self-discipline.	7
5943	I felt happy at the settlement of our marriage, even though we á are from different socio-linguistic backgrounds our parents á agreed to the wedding without any conflict or discussion.  We had  á thought that they would object to the wedding but it did not happen. 	1
5944	One day, early morning my mother who is healthy fell ill.  There á was no doctor or compounder near by and for a few hours -8 A.M to á 6 P.M she did not speak a single sentence, nor did she drink water á or  milk.  There was no movement in her body and I felt really á scared.  I almost lost my confidence about her survival.	2
5945	One day my elder brother badly scolded my father.  This was the á first time that I heard such abusive language from my brother.  I á requested him humbly not to use this kind of language but he did á not care for what I was saying.  Finally I picked up an axe to use á against him, in the meanwhile people intervened.	3
5946	My close friend and I applied to TISS for admission last year, á unfortunately he failed to get admission.  We had done our graduation á together and are quite involved with each other, so we had wanted á to do our Masters degree together.  However, it did not work out á as we had expected it to and this saddened me.	4
5947	My classmate at TISS has the habit of biting his nails and ever á since my childhood I have never liked this habit.  This person is á near me in class, dining hall and the campus so I suggested that á he should stop biting his nails.  However he found it difficult á and my disgust feelings have not changed.	5
5948	I had this feeling before my graduation and never dared to speak á to my relatives and  friends.  Because of this feeling I would á avoid situations, however I do not know the reason for this.	6
5949	One day my mother forced me to eat more and I refused, the next á day she served me more rice and mutton pieces than usual.  When I á saw this I got very angry and scolded her, and refused to eat.  á Later I felt guilty and asked her to excuse me.	7
5950	When I was a student at the Institute doing my M.Phil degree, one á of my professors called me before the convocation and told me á \You have got the gold-medal (first rank) in the university and á	1
5951	When I was in my village one of my enemies had written a á non-sense letter to a girl and he told the father of this girl á that I was the culprit.  When I got to know this I was scared as  á the girl's father was a worse man.	2
5952	When I was doing research a few months ago, I had asked the á Institute to sponsor me for a computer course which was held in á TISS.  However, because of the administrative officer I could not á get the money.	3
5953	When I was in Bombay one of my good friends was getting married á and he had not informed me about it, this made me sad.	4
5954	I once got a phone call stating \one of your friend is in jail, á	5
5955	"Some time back I had signed a letter which I had not read.  What á had happened is that something had been written against my á friend and this went to the higher authorities.  My friend asked me  á -\you also signed ?\""   """	6
5956	One of my friends came to know through some other friends that I   á had applied for some course in an institute.  He asked me \why á	7
5957	The death of Jaya Prakash Narayan caused a great deal of sadness á as I believed that he was the only true democrat and a ray of á hope on the Indian horizon.	4
5958	When I realized that I belonged to a country which is amongst the á poorest in the world and that inspite of having the resources we á do not utilize them.  I was ashamed at myself and my country, á shame at the lack of parity between the lifestyles of the á citizens.	6
5959	When I realized that I was not working hard enough and was not á being useful as an individual to the society or the family, guilt á at spending money on uncalled for activities - in short wasting á my life.	7
5960	My joy knew no bounds when I was selected for a job even before á having finished my studies.	1
5961	I was scared when I realized that I might miss the train which I á was supposed to take.  I was 1500 Kilometres away from home and when  á I heard the depart whistle I was still 150 feet away from the á train.  I finally made it.	2
5962	I felt angry when repeated pleas to the ticket collector and the á co-passengers in order to make a queue fell on deaf ears.  I have á this feeling whenever someone is not disciplined and methodic in á doing his duty.	3
5963	I am filled with gloom and sadness at the death of a person.  á More specifically, I felt sad after hearing the news of a á death of a person who was hale and hearty and full of life, withá vigour and plans for the next day but had no next day to cherish it.	4
5964	I feel disgusted since I am unable to cope with all the wordly á affairs as I spend much precious time to pursue my hobby and á to be admist the people I love and long to be with.	5
5965	I always feel ashamed when I do not succeed in accomplishing á something in which I had put in all my efforts.	6
5966	At times I have been attracted to conducts which are socially á degraded due to their ill consequences, and then I feel guilty.	7
5967	When India first won the world cup cricket tournament.	1
5968	I was then in the 10th standard and was going to my native place. á  The last bus had already left and so I started walking, it soon á became quite dark.  The road was a village road and was deserted, á I was not even sure if that was the right way.  I finally reached á home at 10 P.M.	2
5969	I was travelling from Delhi to Bombay.  I had booked a seat one á month back and I had also got a telegram confirming this.  á However, in the train my name had been omitted from the á reservation sheet, and the one seat that was still vacant was á alloted to another person who paid for it despite my requests for the á seat.  I was allowed to stay in the reserved compartment when I á paid money.	3
5970	The news of the natural calamity, an earthquake in which hundreds  á of Mexican people died.	4
5971	In Punjab, when in the name of religion people killed each other á during the agitation.	5
5972	I felt happy at the end of a 10 day student camp.  We had shared á our hopes and aspirations and in the open situation so generated, we á had made strong frienships and experienced our own worth as well. á  	1
5973	One of my fellow students had bunked field work and in my attempt á to cover up for him I myself was exposed, though not directly.  á We were to meet our field work suprevisor and we were afraid of á the consequences.	2
5974	I had made an error in planning a programme and had publicly á accepted the mistake, despite repeated requests not to bring the á matter for discussion a professor kept constantly passing remarks. á I reacted angrily.á  	3
5975	I was in love with a girl but had to separate from her because of á different commitments concerning life and career.  I loved her as á a person but could not agree with the life the future would á demand.  Parting from her was very sad.	4
5976	Students on campus were unnecessarily creating trouble just to á heckle the authorities - not to achieve something concrete, but á to further their own interest.	5
5977	I had reacted angrily at a friend for no fault of his.  I had á raised my voice and had not cared for his opinion.	6
5978	I had promised to send something to a friend and it completely á slipped my mind.  I felt guilty for having forgotten.	7
5979	This is one feeling I never betray, but I must confess that the á last time I slighty felt happy was when I passed my M.A with a á high rank.  This was a few years ago when my friend told me about á the result.	1
5980	A few weeks back I had a very important seminar and I had á circulated my papers to all the panel members.  A day before the á seminar I realized that I had inadvertantly burdened certain       á derivations and I had failed to correct it.  I feared that this    á would reflect very badly on my performance.  Fortunately none of  á the panel members detected it and I felt relieved.	2
5981	A few days back a friend of mine poked me in the ribs for fun's á sake, though I had warned him an infinite number of times that it á really hurts me, he did it again.

7149	A and I were walking along the new Asia stairway to the Chung Chi á college for our lecture and I saw him with her.  He put one arm á around her shoulder and laugher brightly and joyfully.  I did not á dare and did not want to look, just walked by them quickly.  The á interest of talking to A disappeared and I just wanted to remain á silent.  But I did not want A to know and so I left him and went á to F.  I should have expected this to happen.	4
7150	Knowing that I had to do the survey with him I felt very á reluctant.  Although I do not know him I feel disgusted by just á looking at him.  Thinking that the project lasted several days I á regreted having joined that project.	5
7151	During the lesson the teacher called me and asked me if I had á reported that I was late.  I pretended that I had but looking at á her eyes I knew that she knew that I was lying.  I thought that á it was really bad luck that she had examined the list of the á students who were late.	6

7280	I worked with several classmates on a project.  I was very á anxious about the project while my partners showed no concern  á and when we had meetings on the project my classmates  did not á pay any attention.  Some of them read books while the others á argued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two á hours without the main theme being discussed.  We wasted time and á could not reach a compromise.  My classmates avoided doing the á work and the responsibilities, they seemed to value other á projects more than this one.	3
7281	One of my good friends had to migrate to America.  Our friendship á had developed quite well and it was a pity as our friendship would á fade.	4

7286	My friend and I had offended our classmate unintenionally.  We á wanted to apologize to her so we decided to visit her.  We knew that she á was stubborn so we were frightened.  When we rang her door bell, á our fear was at it's climax	2

7290	Once in primary five, I had forgotten to take a book to class and á the teacher punished me by asking me to stand at the back of the á class.

7300	When I went home and there was nobody, I waited till 2 A.M and      á still nobody.  I was suddenly scared and anxious as this had never á happened before.  In addition my mother was very weak and I á feared that she had met with an accident.  Therefore I was anxious  á all night.	2
7301	Yesterday I read in the newspaper that a 30 year old woman had á abused her 2 month old son and had caused his death.  I was very á angry after reading this as this is not a human act and to abuse á so fragile a life is not a forgivable sin.	3
7302	I had a schoolmate who went to the hospital as her brain was á bleeding.  She fell unconscious for three days and when I went á to see her I saw the miserable state the family was in.  Moreover á I could not do nothing for her.  I was very sad.  Finally, she á died.	4
7303	A tiresome person held me up all day long.  I was very busy then á (I can not remember what the problem was).  He continously tried á to make me talk to him and disturbed me.	5
7304	One day, when I was sitting on the bus, there was an old woman á standing beside me.  I was very tired and sleepy and did not á think of giving her my seat.  A 50 year old woman who was sitting á beside me got up and gave her seat to the old woman and said,  á \ Old woman, please take my seat, the youngstters these days are á	6

7306	I was appreciated by others, especially my family members and my á friends.	1
7307	Whenever I am alone in a dark room, walk alone on the street, á sleep alone in the room at night or see something which is only á partly visible.  This emotion was very strong when as an 8 year   á old child I saw something horrible.  	2
7308	There was a conflict of interest between me and a close friend of á mine.  He only thought about his own interest and not about our á friendship.  This behaviour hurt his friends.  Another incident á is when a friend isolated himself without giving any reasons.	4
7309	When I saw a lot of rubbish and animal waste on the floor.	5
7310	When I was emotionally unstable I said things which may have hurt á others or made them feel unhappy.  When I calmed down I realized á that I had been selfish and had not taken into consideration the á feelings of others.  Then I felt ashamed as someone pointed out my á behaviour to me.	6
7311	When I received the letter informing that I had been accepted to á be a Chinese university student, I was excited as I had longed á for it.	1
7312	One day when I was a little boy, my friends asked me to play á with them outside and to catch some boys.  However our parents á did not know that we were out and when I got home it was very á late and I feared being scolded by my parents.	2
7313	When I learnt that a friend of mine had talked about me to á another friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and á attitudes.  I was very angry.	3
7314	About two years ago my girlfriend suggested that we separate.  á This really gave me a shock as I had never thought that she would á say such things.  The reason she gave me was that we were not á suited for each other.	4
7315	Once while studying for my exam I found so many complicated words á that it disgusted me.	5
7316	When I was young I felt ashamed when our relatives visited us and á I hid myself.	6
7317	I was so excited once that I told my classmate that she was old, á this hurt her and I felt guilty.	7
7318	I am scared when I stroll alone on the Chung Chi college campus. 	2
7319	One day, I discussed a very important question with A.  A á suddenly declared that he would not accept my position and á thought that he himself was right.  Moreover, he attacked  á strongly, not my opinion but me personally.	3
7320	When I learnt that I had failed an exam,  This not only influenced á my emotions but also other important tasks, it also made my á record imperfect.	4
7321	One day I felt dizzy during a lecture.  When the lecturer asked á us as to who had heard the fairy tale - I was the only one who á put up his hand and this surprised the whole class.	6

7323	I felt happy when I received the letter telling me that I had á been admitted to the university.	1
7324	During the first year in university I had bad results in both á the terms, especially the first term.  I was afraid that  I would á not be promoted to the next year and that the others would go á ahead of me.	2
7325	Once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel.	3
7326	A few years ago my mother suffered from canccer and died within á two years.  We had not finished our studies then and could not á bear our responsibilities as her children.  My mother had tried á her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two á years.  Neither the doctor nor we could do anything for her as á cancer is incurable.  I was very eager to replace her in á suffernig , even die instead of her.	4
7327	I used to play with a group of classmates and I found out later á that they were cheap in thought, behaviour and conduct - they á would smoke, fight and speak foul language.  I thought that they á destroyed the image of college students.	5
7328	It was discovered that I had received a warning letter as my á G.P.A was very low.	6
7329	Many years back I quarrelled with my younger brother for a small á reason.  I used a pole to beat him and nearly broke his arm.  He á recovered after a treatment which lasted several months.  After á this our relationship was worse and he would not listen to me.	7
7330	One Saturday afternoon, I deliberately dressed up nicely (I had á been in a bad mood of late).  I hoped to go for a walk in the á soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits.  When I was having á lunch in the canteen, two of my male classmates asked me as to á why I was dressed so nicely (they had seldom joked with me á before).  One of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would á look very nice if we wore them together.	1
7331	The exam was drawing near and I wanted to prepare for it.  But I á had a lot of other things to do so I did not have much time to prepare  á for the exams.  Whenever I sat down to study I was scared that I would  á not be able to finish it.	2
7332	A female classmate was always late for meetings which were for á the homework and not social gatherings.  We were very busy and á the deadline was close but we had to waste half an hour or an á hour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then.	3
7333	After a meeting ended we started talking about when we would á have the next discussion ( I had many tests the coming week and á could not have a meeting in between, I thought that they would á understand this as they had always done).  They did not á understand my problem and thought that I should not have so many á other activities.  Their reaction made me burst into tears.	4
7334	When I was studying in the library a pair of lovers were sitting á next to me talking in an intense and soft voice.  They were á disturbing others.	5
7335	During an informal discussion I contributed a lot even though I á had not spent much time studying.  Whenever someone said that á someone was not paying attention, or that he had too many other á things to do, or that the persoon was not trying his best, I á would feel ashamed.	6
7336	Our class had organized a picnic in November.  I was the class á representative so I became the organizor.  However the picnic á was postponed by one week and I had something else to do then. á Initially I did not ponder on what to do and decided to go for á the picnic.  When I had the time to think about it I thought that á my decision was wrong.  My classmates thought that I would go as á I had signed my name but I did not go.  I told another class á representative that I was not going but he did not know the á reason behind my not going.  After the picnic my classmates asked á me why I had not gone to the picnic and everytime someone á mentioned it I was apologetic.  I should have decided right in á the begining that I would not go and then they would not see me á as irresponsible i.e promising to go and changing my mind á afterwards.	7
7337	It was the first time I met him (my boyfriend Mr.W).  It was á during the first term Summer vacations.  We met each other while á handing in our homework.  He invited me have a trip with him and á we were together till 8 P.M.	1
7338	The day the results of the certificate exam came out.  I went to á school and at first I did not feel frightened.  By the time I á reached the fourth floor ( the results were being given on the á fifth floor) I found it difficult to walk and felt that I would á die.	2
7339	One day I had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back á in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and á wore it.  He had not had a bath and was very dirty.  I scolded him á but he answered back and locked himself up in a room.  I was very á angry so I starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly á and freely.	3
7340	When I was a child I was playing on the upper deck of the bed á with my brother.  My parents slept on the lower deck.  My father á felt disgusted and beat me up.  I felt very sad as my father had á never beaten me or scolded me before.	4
7341	My boyfriend and I did not have any contact with each other during  á the Summer holidays.  I met him the day of the registration and looked  á through him.  In the canteen he asked me if I wanted to have a drink and  á I said no as I did not want him to do me a favour.	5
7342	On Christmas eve I went to a classmate's home with other á classmates.  The next morning when I came out of the toilet she á said something and I did not understand what she was saying.  á When she pointed at my trousers I discovered that I had forgotten á to zip them up.  I rushed back to the toilet but by the time the á others had guessed what had happened.	6
7343	One night,when I was in primary 5 or 6, I felt thirsty so I á fetched the thermos to pour a cup of water for myself.  Then I á saw my brother lowering his head and I, jokingly, poured the       á water on his head.	7

7349	I felt shame when I found that I was almost last in the exam.	6
7350	Once I bought my sister a pair of sports shoes as she was going á to join an athletic meet.  However the shoes were a little big á and had a few flaws.  She muttered all the way and blamed me for á having wasted her money anf I felt guilty.	7

I was very busy at that time and forgot many things; as I á was not very often at home she could not contact me.  When I á started my revision I realized that her notebook had been on my á desk for five days.  I contacted her immediately and gave it back á to her.  Though she did not say anything I felt very guilty.	7
7377	When high level results were declared, I found my candidature á number.  I was very happy as I had not expected it.  As I had been  á injured before the examination and I had performed poorly.	1

7379	When I got into a bus I found that my wallet had been stolen. á It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I á lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to á spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always á remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I á suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil á servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a á criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with á them.	3

Later when we wanted to talk á and his classmates did not even have the decency to listen to him.  á They only asked him a few questions half-heartedly and then they á talked on their own.  Some of their conversation was against me and  á another classmate.	5

I realized that I á had seen her purse on the floor and had not wanted to do any á thing about it. 	6
7390	I went to a friend's baptism as she became a Christian after me á and I realized that she was more enthusiastic about her spiritual á life than I was.

I á thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside.  However the á bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins á were stuck at the opening  of the box.  He had not seen me paying á and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box.  I could not á understand this and the driver kept questioning me.  He made me á feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just á to get away from him.  Later I found that I had forgotten a few á coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first á time.  After I had entered the bus I could still hear him á scolding me and I felt disgusted.	5

The devil did not have any expression on á his face and I thought that he would choose me.	2
7400	My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that á he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's á house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I á felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so á he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is á I was in a bad mood then).	3
7401	I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good á friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them á I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind á this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made á up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was á sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends.	4
7402	I had a friend who was very kind to me.  I tried my best to like á him and understand him but when I was with him I could not help á rejecting, criticizing and blaming him.  I wanted to get away á from him as soon as possible.	5

A close   á friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my á application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had á been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the á list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was á really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all á day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the á good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my á studies. á 	1
7406	A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes á outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would á question me on our relationship.  I treated him as a friend and á did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet á him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very á unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble.	2
7407	We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the á inter-department song contest.  I arrived and found that there á was nobody there.  When I went to the canteen I found them eating á lunch.  I was so angry that I aired my greviances to one of them á and then left.	3

7411	One night during dinner my nephew was naughty, so I quarrelled with my  á parents.   I regreted this as my nephew was only two years old and I  á had to tolerate him !  The quarrel made my father think that his children  á may not take care of him in the future (it was a slip of the tongue and  á this made me realize that my father keeps his thoughts to himself).  I was  á still very angry so I dropped my bowl and chopsticks and went to the kitchen  á to drink tea and then ran to the other side of the house.	7
7412	That afternoon I rushed home to look at the result slip of the á higher level as fast as possible.  I opened the envelope very á carefully and found that my results were much better than I á had expected and thus I could enter the Chinese university.  My á diligence had paid and I was very happy.	1
7413	When I was young I had gone to an old lift and played with the á antique lift.  The guy discovered me and warned me, I was very á frightened.	2

7415	My got my mathematics test's marks and could not believe that it á was true.  In the past I would have at least 80% marks.  Was I á getting weaker at studies ?  This made me feel that I should not á expect too much from going to the university.	4
7416	My friend and I worked for the community centre by holding a booth. á  One day my friend went off to another booth to play.  This á meant that I was very busy and could not maintain order.  His á behaviour disgusted me.	5

7418	At secondary school, one of my classmates lost her locker key.  á During a class I saw two other classmates holding a key and á talking secretly.

I á told the teacher and the person was caught.  He had sold the á books and was forced to quit school.  I found that I had not á helped him as he stole later on also.  I felt guilty	7

7428	My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt á insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did á not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other á friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant á person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that á nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not á say anything but just watched me leave.	3
7429	Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before á the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I á got a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all      á good I felt a little sad.	4

7448	It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I á had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that á I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld á have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period á - I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice á experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable á fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright á prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my á brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue á I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased.	2
7449	The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often á grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This á made me angry.	3
7450	When I was in primary 6, my father died.  I was very young then á and did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives á and my tears made me sad.	4
7451	At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid á doing anyhting that did not concern him.  A few of us prepared lunch á together and had decided to share the work.  My roomate had á promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime á after dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize á his fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a á university student and ought to have self-respect.  He á disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him á and did not want to keep any contact with him.	5
7452	My friend had many female friends and I thought that they were á his lovers.  I would scold him but he did not accept my advice.  á Later I learnt from his girlfriends that this was not true.  I á felt ashamed at having misunderstood him.	6
7453	In the past I used to think that my mother was a very nagging á person.  When I started living at the hostel we had little time á to meet each other.  Whenever I went home she would take care á of me.  I gradually realized that what she had done was for my á own good.  So very time I saw her I felt guilty.	7
7454	"In August,1983, the long awaited \big envelope\"" (a document for á"	1
7455	On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was á afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very á unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of á passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to á repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results á were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a á minor in this subject I would be very unwilling.	2
7456	In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not á like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation á was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt á that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me \ A failure, You lost á	3
7457	This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September á I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in á the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not á find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about á sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  á I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.	4
7458	My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had á melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played á the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell á him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right á to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to á leave the room and go somewhere else.	5
7459	Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was á working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had á joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female á classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not á fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.

7463	Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her á grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in á mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me á and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  á When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be á employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  á there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they á made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five á days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another á child to teach.	3
7464	I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had á prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After á three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and á failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others á would think that I had not prepared for it.	4
7465	I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the á door.  I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit á and bring the germs in the house.	5
7466	I did not do the homework that the teacher had asked us to do.  I á was scolded immediately.	6
7467	I had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when á I called out loudly.	7
